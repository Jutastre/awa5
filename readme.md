# AWA5.0

## What is AWA5.0?
AWA5.0 is a silly esolang related to vtuber Jelly Hoshiumi of Phase-Connect.

## What is in this repo?

### Interpreter

/interpreter/awa5.py is an interpreter written in python.
Execute it with a program named "program.ðŸŒ " in the same folder, or specify a different file with a command line parameter, to run an AWA5.0 program directly.

### Transpiler

/transpiler/awa5transpiler.py takes an AWA5.0 program as input and outputs a human-readable .c file with equivalent function.

#### Usage and options:

    Usage: awa5transpiler.py [options] source_file

    source_file defaults to "program.ðŸŒ "

    output_file defaults to appending ".ðŸŒ " to source_file unless source_file ends
    with ".c", in which case the ".c" will be replaced by ".ðŸŒ ".

    if output_file is "stdout" output will be written to stdout instead

    Options:

        -a, --parse-args                makes the output program read command line
                                        arguments as input (once arguments are 
                                        exhausted it will revert back to user 
                                        input)

        -f source_file                  specify input file to read awatalk from

        -h, --help                      displays this text

        -ir, --output-ir                outputs IR instead of c code

        --no-inline                     makes functions in output not static inline

        -o output_file                  specify output filename

        -O                              enable optimizer pass

        -p, --pipe                      sets source_file and output_file to stdin 
                                        and stdout respectively

        --surround-on-merge-simple      makes merge instruction surround instead of
                                        add when both top bubbles are simple (this
                                        matches other implementations, but not the
                                        specification)

### Tools

/tools/ir_to_awa.py translates from a simple intermediate representation into proper awatalk for the interpreter or transpiler to read.
The transpiler can output the same IR if the flag -ir is used.

IR example:

    5 0
    5 1
    5 0
    5 1
    5 0
    9 5
    1

Just some random thoughts on what could be changed/improved in future iterations of the language.
