unclear/undefined behaviour that maybe should be defined:

SURROUND_ON_SIMPLE_MERGE

count and comparisons with empty/too short abyss

does print num print numbers? why does it mention AwaSCII?
also 'pops them all' is slightly ambigous

ideas for future versions of AWA5:

extend AwaSCII with an extra bit to fit carriage return + 63 emojis

division without modulo and modulo without division would be neat

some kind of syscall and/or websocket instructions as seen in other interpreters?
